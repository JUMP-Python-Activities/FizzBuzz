# FizzBuzz!
- Write a program that accepts a user’s integer input
  - For every integer between 0 and that number, add the following to a list:
  - If the number is divisible by 3, add “Fizz”
  - If the number if divisible by 5, add “Buzz”
  - If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, add “Fizzbuzz”
  - If the number is divisible by neither, add the number itself to the list
  - Loop over the list and print each element in that list, then print the sum of all integers, and the count of Fizz, Buzz and Fizzbuzz
- Return the fizzbuzz list at the end of the function
